// You can bring module paths into scopes and provide new names for them with

// Execute `rustlings hint modules2` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.


// When we bring a name into scope with the use keyword, the name available in the new scope is private. 
// To enable the code that calls our code to refer to that name as if it had been defined in that codeâ€™s scope, 
// we can combine pub and use.
